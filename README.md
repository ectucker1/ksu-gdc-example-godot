# Example Godot Game

This was an example game made during a K-State Game Dev Club meeting.

It's a basic platformer, including jumping, enemies, stomping, and lives.

If you're looking to get a sense of how it works, the best way is to download [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)
and open up `src/main.tscn`, `src/player.tscn`, and `src/player.gd`.
